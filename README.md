•This repository consists of files required to deploy a Web App created with Flask on Microsoft Azure.# diabetes Heart Disease predictor The project helps the user to identify whether someone is suffering from Heart Disease by simply inputting certain values like BMI, Glucose level, Blood pressure etc. with the help of a Kaggle database.

By using the statistical data about how certain aspects like BMI, Glucose level, Insulin level, age etc. Impact if an individual is prone to Heart Disease or not, the project will be able to tell the user if the person has Heart problems or not by entering those values. So in a way the project will help in monitoring the likelihood of someone developing Heart Disease. The project can be extended to include other diseases prediction which I will incorporate later down the road.

### Problem Statement/Oppurtunity:
Heart diseases is a term covering any disorder of the heart. Heart diseases have become a major concern to deal with as studies show that the number of deaths due to heart diseases have increased significantly over the past few decades in India, in fact it has become the leading cause of death in India.
A study shows that from 1990 to 2016 the death rate due to heart diseases have increased around 34 per cent from 155.7 to 209.1 deaths per one lakh population in India.
Thus preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

### Project Discription:
The modern lifestyle or fast forward life has significant impact on lives of people. Many people across the globe are suffering from heart related diseases due to stress, lifestyle habits and some from genes irrespective of their age. The objective of this article is to predict the occurrence of heart disease in early stages, so that it will help doctors to take proactive measures to control many lives of the people. Although there is traditional approach in hospitals for dealing with heart issues but most of them are re-active, they can only know after its occurrence and hospitals cannot handle huge amount of data that generates each day related to patient’s data, so it becomes difficult for doctors to make accurate predictions. In this paper, machine learning techniques are used for prediction as they can handle huge data and their performance is high. Classification models that are part of machine learning techniques are used, as they play key role in prediction. In this project, Random Forest algorithm along with some other classification algorithms are used to predict the heart disease. The purpose of this project is to reduce the deaths caused due to heart diseases and to predict its occurrence efficiently.
Machine learning techniques Provide better result for prediction by con- structing models from datasets collected from patients. In this work we will use Machine Learning Classification and ensemble techniques on a dataset to predict Heart Disease. Which are K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting (GB) and Random Forest (RF). The accuracy is different for every model when compared to other models. The Project work gives the accurate or higher accuracy model shows that the model is capable of predicting Heart Disease effectively. Our Result shows that Random Forest achieved higher accuracy compared to other machine learning techniques. The is a Microsoft Azure Web App project that helps the user to identify whether someone is suffering from Heart Disease by simply inputting certain values like Age, sex, chest pain type, Resting Blood Pressure, Serum Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, ECG Results, Max Heart Rate, etc. with the help of Kaggle database.

### Primary Ajure Technology:
Azure Web Apps , AI+Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Static Web Apps, Web Apps

### Conclusion:
Hence we succesfully predict that any person having Heart Disease or not.

Thank You
